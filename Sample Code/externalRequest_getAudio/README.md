# externalRequest_getAudio

*This example was last tested on `robotVersion 1.16.1.10505`*

This sample shows how to code Misty to get an audio file from an external resource. In this case, Misty saves the audio file to her local storage and plays it back through her on-board speakers.

You can run this code on your robot by uploading the files from this folder to Misty via the Skill Runner web tool. Alternately, refer to this code sample (or copy and paste it into your own skills) when working on similar functionality.
