# Misty I Sample Code
To run these examples, you'll first need to use the green __Clone or download__ button on the [MistyI page](https://github.com/MistyCommunity/MistyI) to copy the files onto your desktop. This will also ensure that you have the Tools Directory in the same folder as the skill folders, which is needed for them to run. Then, just open up the .html file for any code sample. It should open into a browser window. 

For many samples, you can simply enter your robot's IP address and start execution. Other samples require you to manually input your robot's IP address in the .html file. For a better view into the commands being sent to your robot, open the JavaScript console for the browser window.
