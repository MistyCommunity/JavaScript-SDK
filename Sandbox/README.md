# JavaScript SDK Sandbox

We use the sandbox directory to share code that is a work-in-progress, and to host skills and code samples that are not actively maintained by the Misty team. Some things might not work on the first try. If you get stuck, don't hesitate to ask a question in the [Misty Community Forums](https://community.mistyrobotics.com).

Some of this code requires a robot with customized external hardware or third-party integrations, and you may encounter deprecated API commands. Proceed with caution, a sense of adventure, and a healthy tolerance for bugs. We believe that sharing this code, even in its unmaintained state, can serve to spark creativity and help developers learn about the Misty II platform.
